College honors project
This is a Demo/proof of concept for a turn-based strategy game. You can attack the enemy units, and they will counterattack. Defeating everything loads a new level, for a total of 3.
The game engine is made from scratch with Java Swing, so it's not particularly great. Currently, this project is abandoned, and if I pick it back up I'll start over with a new engine and language.
